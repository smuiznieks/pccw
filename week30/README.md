# Week 30

Make sure you mitigate the following gotchas:

## Backend

- `const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;`
- [Make sure you are using cors!](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html)

## Heroku

- Set up automatic deployments so you don't accidentally miss something!

## Examples:

- API: https://github.com/smuiznieks/fullstack
- UI: https://github.com/smuiznieks/fullstack-ui
- API Deployment: https://my-fancy-backend.herokuapp.com/
- UI Deployment: https://my-fancy-ui.herokuapp.com/
